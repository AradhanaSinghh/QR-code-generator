# QR-code-generator
Developed a web-based QR code generator using HTML, CSS, and JS API. 
The QR code generator allows users to enter any text or URL and generate a QR code that can be scanned by a smartphone camera. 
The QR code generator uses a third-party API called as QR Code Generator API , to generate the QR code.
The API takes the user's input and returns a PNG image of the QR code that is then displayed on the page.
